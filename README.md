# coolOS
A bootloader written in assembly, a start for a project to write a basic operating system, currently loads up and prints a message after booting up.

so run ```make``` first but basic floppy image is already uploaded
then use qemu to run ```qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main_floppy.img```
and it works!!!
